1. Duplicate all the files in the parent directory of the Starshot directory.
2. Open and run init_germania.py, init_silica.py, init_gap.py in a Python editor.
* These will help to understand how to initialise a material.
* There are notes written in these files to help the user.
* It is recommended to go through these files in the order written above. 
3. Run init_alumina.py and init_si3n4.py
